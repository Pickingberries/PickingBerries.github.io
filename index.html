            <p>My name is Brendan Berry, and I was born and raised in Encinitas, California. Ever since I was young, I have always had an interest in technology and how it works.
                Even when I was a kid, I would play starfox and supermario with my grandma and looking back they are memories that I am very fond of. As I grew up, I continued playing games
                and learning about new tech that was being invented and it wasn't until highschool that I learned about coding and how important it is. I've always been interested in what is behind
                the scenes of the games I grew up playing and now that I'm learning how to do it all, I am very excited.
